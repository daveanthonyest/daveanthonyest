##About Me üåç
Hi, I'm David Estrada, a Computer Engineering student at San Diego State University with a strong foundation in C, Python, Java, Verilog, and MIPS Assembly. My career began in the U.S. Navy as an Electronic Technician Nuclear 2nd Class, where I operated nuclear reactors aboard the USS Nimitz.

After the Navy, I transitioned into building automation systems, working as a System Specialist at Climatec. There, I gained experience with the EC-gfxProgram to optimize HVAC systems using BACnet and LONWORKS protocols. Now, I‚Äôm focused on embedded systems and innovative software development.
